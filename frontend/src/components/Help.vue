      hey there solder, you great piece of low melting point metal alloy ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡
    </p>

    <p>
      in kartoffels you're programmer leading your robot into the victory - in
      this house:
    </p>

    <p>
      - maps are two-dimensional
      <br />
      - bots contain peripherals (motor, radar & arm) that your code controls
      <br />
      - your code runs on an emulated RISC-V CPU clocked at 64 KHZ (+ you've got
      128 KB RAM)
      <br />
      - the game is simulated on a central server -- let the meritocracy thrive
    </p>

    <p>
      the purpose of your robot is, of course, to survive and kill as many enemy
      robots as possible - and everybody's an enemy
    </p>

    <p>
      now, enough talk - start by following this carefully crafted instruction:
    </p>

    <pre>
      $ git clone https://github.com/patryk27/kartoffel
      $ cd kartoffel
      $ ./build</pre
    >

    <p>
      ... and then go back, select any map and upload <kbd>./kartoffel</kbd> -
      have fun & improve!
    </p>

    <p>in-game controls boil down to arrow keys / WASD, and mouse</p>

    <p class="note">
      <b>note, soldier!</b> if you want to practice without submitting your bot
      just yet, choose the <kbd>sandbox</kbd> map - it is simulated in your
      browser and provides extra debugging facilities
    </p>
