      hey there solder, you great piece of low-melting-point metal alloy
      ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡
    </p>

    <p>
      in kartoffels you're not just a spool of lead metal anymore, you're the
      lead programmer responsible for leading your bots into the victory
    </p>

    <p>
      here's a couple of things you need to know to get started:
    </p>

    <p>
      - maps are two-dimensional and vary in type (arena, dungeon etc.)
      <br>
      - robots are represented with the <i>@</i> sign (you'll see later)
      <br>
      - robots contain peripherals (radar, motors etc.) which your code can
        play with
      <br>
      - every tick each robot in randomized order executes a single CPU
        instruction
      <br>
      - there's 64k ticks per bot per second
      <br>
      - the game is simulated on a central server, so you're playing against
        other players
      <br>
      - also, the game is anonymous - let meritocracy thrive
    </p>

    <p>

    <p>
      now, much too much talk, grug wants start
    </p>

    <pre>
      $ git clone github.com/patryk27/kartoffels-bot
      $ cd kartoffels-bot
      $ cargo build --release
    </pre>

    <p>
      having this ready, go back to the main page, select any map and start
      playing, improving your bot as you go!
    </p>

    <p>
      (( controls boil down to arrow keys (or WASD) and the up-front visible
      buttons ))
