      hey there solder, you great piece of low melting point metal alloy

    <p>
      in kartoffels you're the lead programmer responsible for leading your
      bot into the victory - in this house:
    </p>

    <p>
      - maps are two-dimensional and vary in type (arena, dungeon etc.)
      <br />
      - robots contain peripherals (radar, motors etc.) that your code
        (aka firmware) controls
      <br />
      - firmwares run on emulated RISC-V CPUs clocked at 64 KHz
      <br />
      - game is simulated on a central server and it's anonymous - let the
        meritocracy thrive
    </p>

      now, much too much talk, grug wants start:
    </p>

    <pre>
      $ git clone github.com/patryk27/kartoffels-bot
      $ cd kartoffels-bot
      $ cargo build --release</pre>

    <p>
      then go back, select any map, upload
      <i>`target/release/riscv64-unknown-bot/bot`</i> and play with the code!
    </p>

    <p>
      (( in-game controls boil down to arrow keys (or WASD) and the mouse ))
