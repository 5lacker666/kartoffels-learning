## Name

kartoffel (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª)    
= potato    
= slang for "slow machine"    
= exactly what kartoffel bots are - slow machines they are indeed!

## Running locally

### On NixOS

Flake already contains an example configuration, so it's as easy as:

```
$ sudo nixos-container create demo
$ sudo nixos-container start demo
```

... and then just open the listed IP in your web browser.

### On other machines

Start backend:

```
$ mkdir /tmp/kartoffels
$ cd backend
$ cargo run --release -- --data /tmp/kartoffels
```

Start frontend:

```
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Create a map:

```
POST http://localhost:1313/worlds
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "the arena",
  "mode": {
    "type": "deathmatch"
  },
  "theme": {
    "type": "arena",
    "radius": 20
  }
}
```

Enjoy!
