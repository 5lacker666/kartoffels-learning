## name

kartoffel (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª)    
= potato    
= slang for _slow machine_    
= exactly what kartoffels are!

## build

so you want to launch kartoffels on your own machine? easy!

### using nix

```bash
# step i: clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/patryk27/kartoffels
$ cd kartoffels

# step ii: create a place for storing kartoffels, server keys etc.
$ mkdir store

# step iii: launch server
$ nix run . -- serve ./store --ssh 127.0.0.1:1314

# step iiii: join the game
$ ssh 127.0.0.1 -p1314
```

note that this only starts the ssh server - if you want to use the web frontend:

```bash
# step iii: launch server (note the `--http` argument)
$ nix run . -- serve ./store --http 127.0.0.1:1313

# step iiii: launch frontend
$ nix run .#web

# step iiiii: join the game at http://localhost:5173
```

### on linux / macos

```bash
# step i: clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/patryk27/kartoffels
$ cd kartoffels

# step ii: build application
$ cd app
$ cargo build --release
$ cd ..

# step iii: create a place for storing kartoffels, server keys etc.
$ mkdir store

# step iiii: launch server
$ ./app/target/release/kartoffels serve ./store --ssh 127.0.0.1:1314

# step iiiii: join the game
$ ssh 127.0.0.1 -p1314
```

note that this only starts the ssh server - if you want to use the web frontend:

```bash
# step iiii: launch server (note the `--http` argument)
$ ./app/target/release/kartoffels serve ./store --http 127.0.0.1:1313

# step iiiii: launch frontend
$ cd web
$ npm install
$ npm run dev

# step iiiiii: join the game at http://localhost:5173
```

### on windows

i'd suggest installing wsl and following the linux instructions

## contribute

so you want to contribute to kartoffels? easy! -- the code is divided into
roughly three areas:

- all things risc-v (`kartoffels-cpu`),
- all things world-and-bot (`kartoffels-world`),
- all things user-interface (`kartoffels-front`).

so, say:

- if you wanted to introduce support for risc-v compressed instructions, you'd
  modify (mostly) `kartoffels-cpu`,
- if you wanted to introduce a new bot peripheral, you'd modify (mostly)
  `kartoffels-world`,
- if you wanted to introduce a new challenge, you'd modify (mostly)
  `kartoffels-front`.

note that those are just rough examples, different features or fixes might
require touching different places

also:

- use `cargo test --release` and `cargo fmt`,
- some tests (notably those ui-based) utilize snapshots - they take a
  "screenshot" (a textshot?) of the current frame and compare it against the
  expected frame - you can run `just test-and-bless` to quickly fix such tests
  after you e.g. modify a commonly-used ui widget,
- pls don't introduce larger changes (e.g. a new peripheral) without some
  discussion first - it might happen that something hasn't been implemented
  deliberately and i wouldn't like for people to waste time just to tell them
  "sorry, it doesn't fit my vision"
