## Name

kartoffel (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª)    
= potato    
= slang for "slow machine"    
= exactly what kartoffel bots are - slow machines they are indeed!

## Getting started

TODO

## Running locally

### On NixOS

Flake already contains an example configuration, so it's as easy as:

```
$ sudo nixos-container create demo
$ sudo nixos-container start demo
```

... and then just open listed IP in your web browser.

### On other machines

```
$ mkdir /tmp/kartoffels

$ cd backend
$ cargo build-roberto
$ cargo run --release -- --data /tmp/kartoffels --quick-start
```

```
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
