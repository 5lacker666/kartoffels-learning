â a bot who knows what it wants is most admirable              â
â                                                              â
â but sometimes a bot's reasoning system goes mental and       â
â decides that what they want is a longer antenna... and they  â
â do stupid things to achieve this goal                        â
â                                                              â
â like making a pact with the devil                            â
â                                                              â
â poor fella thought it's getting an upgrade, while in reality â
â the fiendish devil just took the bot's wheels and left it to â
â rot in the top-left corner of the maze                       â
â                                                              â
â show mercy: implement a robot that traverses the maze,       â
â locates that other bot and kills it - you'll be starting in  â
â the bottom-right corner                                      â
â                                                              â
