        âââââââââââââââââââââââââââ tutorial âââââââââââââââââââââââââââ
        â first, the peripheral it's actually not a knife - it's arm   â
        â                                                              â
        â but the only action currently exposed by this peripheral is  â
        â arm_stab(), so...                                            â
        â                                                              â
        â # arm_wait()                                                 â
        â                                                              â
        â as you can guess, this boi waits until the arm is ready      â
        â (until it's armed, you could say)                            â
        â                                                              â
        â # arm_stab()                                                 â
        â                                                              â
        â stabs the bot that's directly in front of you, killing it    â
        â and giving your robot one point - note that you have to be   â
        â facing the other bot in order to stab it                     â
        â                                                              â
        â easy enough, isn't it?                                       â
        â                                                              â
        â now, to complete the tutorial, implement a bot that does a   â
        â 3x3 radar scan, rotates towards the closest enemy robot      â
        â ('@'), goes forward and stabs it; when no enemy is in sight, â
        â let your robot continue moving in its current direction      â
        â                                                              â
        â for simplicity, the enemies will not try to kill you and     â
        â they will be located directly north / east / west / south -  â
        â i.e. you don't have to worry about diagonals                 â
        â                                                              â
