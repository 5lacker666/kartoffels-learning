        # # arm_wait()                                                 #
        #                                                              #
        # as you can guess, this boi waits until the arm is ready      #
        # (until it's armed, you could say)                            #
        #                                                              #
        # # arm_stab()                                                 #
        #                                                              #
        # stabs the bot that's directly in front of you, killing it    #
        # and giving your robot one point - note that you have to be   #
        # facing the other bot in order to stab it                     #
        #                                                              #
        # easy enough, isn't it?                                       #
        #                                                              #
        # now, to complete the tutorial, implement a bot that does a   #
        # 3x3 radar scan, rotates towards the closest enemy ('@'),     #
        # goes forward and stabs it; when no enemy is in sight, let    #
        # your robot continue moving in its current direction          #
        #                                                              #
        # for simplicity, the enemies will not try to kill you and     #
        # they will be located directly north / east / west / south -  #
        # i.e. you don't have to worry about diagonals                 #
        #                                                              #
        #                                                 [enter] next #
