        # cool!                                                        #
        #                                                              #
        # now let's try to unwrap what the code in main.rs does:       #
        #                                                              #
        # # motor_step()                                               #
        #                                                              #
        # this boi causes the bot to move one tile in the direction    #
        # the robot is currently facing (north / east / west / south)  #
        #                                                              #
        # # motor_turn_*()                                             #
        #                                                              #
        # this boi causes the bot to turn left (counterclockwise) or   #
        # right (clockwise)                                            #
        #                                                              #
        # # motor_wait()                                               #
        #                                                              #
        # this boi waits until the motor is ready to accept another    #
        # command                                                      #
        #                                                              #
        # waiting for readiness is important, because the cpu is much  #
        # faster than motor, so - say - calling motor_step() two times #
        # in a row without motor_wait() in-between would actually move #
        # the bot just one tile forward                                #
        #                                                              #
        #                                                 [enter] next #
