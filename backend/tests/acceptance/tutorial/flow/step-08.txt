        â cool!                                                        â
        â                                                              â
        â now let's try to unwrap what the code in main.rs does:       â
        â                                                              â
        â # motor_step()                                               â
        â                                                              â
        â this boi causes the bot to move one tile in the direction    â
        â the robot is currently facing (north / east / west / south)  â
        â                                                              â
        â # motor_turn_*()                                             â
        â                                                              â
        â this boi causes the bot to turn left (counterclockwise) or   â
        â right (clockwise)                                            â
        â                                                              â
        â # motor_wait()                                               â
        â                                                              â
        â this boi waits until the motor is ready to accept another    â
        â command                                                      â
        â                                                              â
        â waiting for readiness is important, because the cpu is much  â
        â faster than motor, so - say - calling motor_step() two times â
        â in a row without motor_wait() in-between would actually move â
        â the bot just one tile forward                                â
        â                                                              â
