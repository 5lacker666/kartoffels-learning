        # welcome to the online mode! -- in here you're playing        #
        # against bots programmed by other people, deathmatch-style    #
        #                                                              #
        # if you want to learn how to create your own bot, go back to  #
        # the main menu and press [t] - but here's the spirit:         #
        #                                                              #
        # # rules                                                      #
        #                                                              #
        # - your bot gets a point for each bot killed                  #
        # - unless the upload queue is full, each killed bot gets      #
        #   auto-respawned upon death, to keep the party going         #
        #                                                              #

        # - use mouse and/or keyboard                                  #
        # - press [u] to upload a bot                                  #
        # - press [w/a/s/d] or arrow keys to move the camera           #
        # - click on any bot visible on map to join it                 #
